<h2 align="center">function</h2>

this "client" embeds [thelazysquid/gimkitcheat](https://github.com/TheLazySquid/GimkitCheat) in the site, allowing you to use it anywhere, even on a Chromebook! this allows for cheating during class...without the struggle of blocked scripts at all! the repository fetches and "updates" the cheat anytime the program is started, so you can quite simply just run the program and never worry about updating or maintaining anything.
